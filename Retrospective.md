## Experience

Learning to implement python into the website was challenging and I feel like i ended up using an unsecrure and hacky way but it works! 

The hardest part of this project was getting the gif to load after it was rendered. I wanted to have the website got to a new page that displayed the gif but getting the address to the gif to display on a new page kept giving me issues and the getter wouldn't load it. Eventually I just had to redirect the website to the gif directly after it finished rendering.
